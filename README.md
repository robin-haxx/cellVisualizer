# Audio-responsive Conway's Game of Life
# Now with 8 songs and style/resolution settings!

An audio-responsive game of life, made combining Dan Shiffman's p5.js implementation of Conway's Game of Life and a music visualizer framework from a uni course.

I've stripped back the code I was provided, and added to it, to make a nicer web app for you to mess with. Sorry about the longer load times and edge-roughness!
There's support for loading more songs, I'm just limiting to 8 for performance. There's also code to support having multiple "playlists" of 8 to randomly select from on page reload. But instead of building a few of them in I had to find the file that kept breaking everything (it was feel good inc.'s volume data :[ )
