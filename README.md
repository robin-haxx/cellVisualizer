# Audio-responsive Conway's Game of Life
# Now with 15 songs and style/resolution settings!

An audio-responsive game of life, made combining Dan Shiffman's p5.js implementation of Conway's Game of Life and a music visualizer framework from a uni course.

I've stripped back the code I was provided, and added to it, to make a nicer web app for you to mess with. Sorry about the longer load times and edge-roughness!
